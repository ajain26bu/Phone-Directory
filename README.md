# Phone-Directory
-Your program should be able to create a new phone directory by reading from a text file.
To do this, implement a “ void create(String filePath )” function. In the text file, the name
and phone number of a person should be separated by a comma, and there should be
only one pair of a name and phone number per line.
-Once a phone directory is created as described above, sort all entries and display all the
entries in alphabetical order of the Last name. If multiple persons in the directory have
the same Last name, sort them based on their First name. If they have the same first
and last name, sort them based on their phone number. For this, implement “ void
sortDirectory() ” function. In the function,implement the merge sort algorithm to sort
names and implement the randomized quicksort algorithm to sort phone numbers of
the persons with the same name.
- After displaying the sorted phone directory, search for a given name, e.g., Bob Smith. If
found, print its location in the directory, the name, and phone number. If multiple persons
in the directory have the same name, print all of them. Otherwise, return “Name not
found” message. Use the binary search algorithm to do this. For this, implement “ void
searchDirectory(char* name) ” function.
-Implement “ void deleteEntry(char* name) ” function that searches for the name passed
as the parameter, and delete the name and phone number found by search. If multiple
persons with the same name are found, only delete the name and phone number of the
parson who appears last in the sorted order. If not found, print “unable to delete as entry
not found”
-Implement “ void insertEntry(char* name, char* phone_number) ” to insert a new pair
of a name and phone number to the directory, and make sure to keep the directory
sorted after the insertion. If the directory already has the same name and phone number,
print a message “entry already exist in the directory”
